Convert DEM files from DP to STL file for 3D printing

**BEWARE**: This code is hard-coded for a specific file author have, not for generic "any-file".

But if there are too many people asking that (politely),
I might be able to come up with converter from some file (say, SRTM DEMs?)...when I really have that time.
